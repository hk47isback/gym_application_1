# Active Context

## Current Development State

### Recently Completed âœ…

- **Code Conflicts Fixed**: Removed duplicate Exercise class, fixed HiveService syntax errors
- **Default Data Population**: Complete exercise library with 33+ exercises across 6 muscle groups
- **Weekly Plan Implementation**: 5-day workout structure (Monday-Friday) with rest weekends
- **Enhanced Home Screen**: Real "today's workout" logic with streak counter
- **Improved Workout Screen**: Set-by-set tracking, weight/rep input, completion checkboxes
- **Settings Screen**: Theme toggle, profile management, app preferences
- **Streak System**: Automatic streak updates on workout completion
- **Exercise Library**: Functional CRUD interface with muscle group filtering

### Active Work Items

#### 1. Code Quality Issues (Immediate)

**Problem**: Duplicate Exercise model definitions causing conflicts

- `lib/models/exercise.dart` (correct version)
- `lib/models/workout.dart` (conflicting Exercise class)
  **Action Required**: Remove duplicate Exercise from workout.dart

**Problem**: Syntax error in hive_service.dart

- Line 95: Invalid filtering syntax for exercises by muscle group
  **Action Required**: Fix the getExercisesForMuscleGroup method

#### 2. Missing Core Functionality

**Weekly Plan System**:

- No predefined 5-day workout structure
- No assignment of muscle groups to specific days
- No "today's workout" logic

**Exercise Library**:

- No default exercises populated
- ExerciseLibraryScreen skeleton only
- No CRUD interface for exercise management

**Settings Implementation**:

- SettingsScreen is not implemented
- No theme switching functionality
- No user profile management

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

#### Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues

1. **Fix Code Conflicts** (30 minutes)

   - Remove duplicate Exercise class from workout.dart
   - Fix hive_service.dart syntax error
   - Run build_runner to regenerate adapters

2. **Populate Default Data** (1 hour)
   - Create default muscle groups (Chest, Back, Legs, Shoulders, Arms)
   - Add 15-20 basic exercises per muscle group
   - Set up default 5-day weekly plan

#### Phase 2: Complete MVP Flow (2-3 hours)

3. **Today's Workout Logic**

   - Implement day-of-week detection
   - Connect weekly plan to home screen
   - Show actual exercises for today

4. **Workout Session Enhancement**

   - Improve exercise selection dialog
   - Add set-by-set completion tracking
   - Implement proper workout finishing flow

5. **Basic Settings Screen**
   - Theme toggle (light/dark)
   - User profile basic fields
   - Units preference (kg/lb)

#### Phase 3: Polish & Testing (1-2 hours)

6. **Streak Integration**

   - Show streak counter on home screen
   - Update streak on workout completion
   - Add visual celebration for milestones

7. **Exercise Library Screen**
   - List all exercises by muscle group
   - Basic add/edit functionality
   - Exercise details view

## Current Technical Debt

### High Priority

- **Model Conflicts**: Duplicate Exercise definitions
- **Syntax Errors**: Broken filtering in HiveService
- **Missing Data**: No default exercises or weekly plans

### Medium Priority

- **Error Handling**: No validation in data operations
- **State Management**: Basic setState usage, needs improvement
- **UI Polish**: Placeholder text and basic styling

### Low Priority

- **Code Organization**: Some services could be split
- **Documentation**: Missing inline documentation
- **Testing**: No unit tests written yet

## Development Environment Notes

### Build Commands

```bash
# Generate Hive adapters
flutter packages pub run build_runner build

# Clean generated files
flutter packages pub run build_runner clean

# Watch for changes
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
```

### Known Working Features

- App launches and initializes Hive properly
- Navigation between screens works
- Basic workout screen layout functional
- Data models properly defined

### Broken/Incomplete Features

- Exercise filtering by muscle group (syntax error)
- Today's workout detection (no weekly plan data)
- Settings screen (not implemented)
- Exercise library management (skeleton only)

## User Testing Status

### Not Yet Tested

- Complete workout flow end-to-end
- Streak calculation accuracy
- Data persistence across app restarts
- Performance with large exercise datasets

### Next Testing Goals

1. Full workout session completion
2. Data integrity after app restart
3. Navigation flow usability
4. Performance on older Android devices

## Deployment Readiness

### Current State: Pre-Alpha

**Missing for Beta**:

- Default data population
- Complete workout flow
- Basic settings functionality
- Streak counter integration

**Missing for Production**:

- Error handling and validation
- User testing feedback incorporation
- Performance optimization
- Icon and branding assets
